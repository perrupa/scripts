9340595 NO-JIRA - Per Marlow's comments on the code review, remove the config lines that relate to a specific vim plugin that isn't installed in vagrant
829d5e6 PRODEV-1844 Squashed commit of the following:
5c79d3d NO-JIRA - Fixing errors in vimrc that Marlow pointed out, where the commands were on the same line as the comment. Also changed bashrc to .bash_profile as that is what it is installed at now, so good to be consistent. Updated customization sample to refer to bash_profile instead of bashrc
8f7afeb NO-JIRA - undo my ff merge
70cf64b Merge branch 'feature/vagrant-repo-key-changes' into develop
368e16c NO-JIRA - Change Vagrant setup so that if you already have an SSH config with the tools repo, then it won't require the service.repo.pem key. In the latest dev environment setup the SSH config will be created for the tor-admin01 with the dev's credentials, so the service.repo.pem is not longer necessary.

4666e1e NO-JIRA - Moving bashrc and vimrc to the codebase instead of in the box. Re-added the alters command, eventually will make it defer to grunt. Fixed sh issues with function names with dashes.
0e1994d NO-JIRA - Now that PHPUnit is installed through composer instead of PEAR, there is no phpunit command in the shell. Have to explicitly invoke the phpunit PHP file.

5b38dd0 NO-JIRA - Moving a bunch of vagrant stuff into the codebase, lock-step with changes to the vagrant box. Updated to use the latest dev db/platform content (post-bohr)
1125d30 ZAP-7333 - Set hash using window.location.hash (compatible with all browsers) instead of parsing the full URL and setting it. I believe this was a false positive from Burp because the code always gets the URL up to the first hash and then appends the new one, so regardless of what the attacker does it will get the real program URL first (otherwise the URL would not be valid).
